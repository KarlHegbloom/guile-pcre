README for guile-pcre
---------------------

guile-pcre is a set of language bindings to provide guile programs
with access to pcre (Perl-compatible regular expression library).

VERSION
-------

This is verion 1.0 of guile-pcre.

LIMITATIONS
-----------

No attempt has been made to support pcre external tables (locale
overrides), or external patterns, or reference counting.  As such
there's no support for:

 - pcre_maketables
 - pcre_config flags PCRE_INFO_DEFAULT_TABLES, PCRE_INFO_FIRSTTABLE,
                     or PCRE_INFO_NAMETABLE.
 - pcre_pattern_to_host_byte_order
 - pcre_refcount

Partial matching should be supported later.
Extracting named substrings from match should be supported later.

Part of the motivation for this work was an apparent absense of
similar functionality elsewhere.  It looks like Rob Browning started
down this path is 2002 bug got bogged down in license incompatibility.

It still isn't clear that Rob Browning could have released what he had
done, but pcre is now listed in the FSF free software directory
http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/PCRE.  So it seems safe, now, to use
pcre from guile programs.

GPL Version 3 was selected because guile is licensed under LICENSE.
Since guile-pcre is fully dependent on guile, there seems no need for
an alternate license.

In the event that license incompatability becomes an issue, the author
